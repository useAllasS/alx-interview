# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Tasks
### [0. Island Perimeter]()

Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

- [x] grid is a list of list of integers:
    - [x] 0 represents water
    - [x] 1 represents land
    - [x] Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
    - [x] Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    - [x] grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- [x] The grid is completely surrounded by water
- [x] There is only one island (or nothing).
- [x] The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
